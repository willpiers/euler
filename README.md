Euler
=====

A compilation of project euler problems I have worked on,
as well as helper methods that have been written to help in solving these
mathematically-oriented problems.

In Progess
--
This project is a work in progress. I'm working to move all solutions to the solutions directory

Solutions
--
To get the solution to a particular problem, run
```sh
ruby solutions/<problem_number>.rb
```

Tests
--
I've written tests for some of the methods I've added to Integer and the euler-specific module I've written. Tests can be run with
```sh
rspec spec
```
